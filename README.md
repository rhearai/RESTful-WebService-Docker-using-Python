# RESTful-WebService-Docker-using-Python
Our database consists of a collection of chocolates their name, title, id and base. 
Our entity is chocDB 
We have displayed our collection of records wherein all the entities in our record has been displayed
We have then displayed a single record using ID no “1004” which displays ‘title’= ‘Small’.
Next, we have displayed collection of records for ID no “1004” having ‘title’ as ‘Small’ which displays output of base as “Toffee”.
We have displayed a single record for the base “Toffee”.
The data returned is in the form of JSON as we’ve used ‘jsonify’ method.
Therefore, we’ve successfully created a RESTful web service using Flask in a docker container.
